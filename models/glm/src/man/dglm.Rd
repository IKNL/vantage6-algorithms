\usage{
dglm(
  client,
  formula,
  dstar = NULL,
  types = NULL,
  family = gaussian,
  tol = 1e-08,
  maxit = 25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{client}{vtg::Client instance, profided by the node}

\item{formula}{an object of class formula (or one that can be coerced to that
class: a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. E.g.:
dependant_variable ~ explanatory_variable(i) + ...}

\item{dstar}{name of the dstar sensor column (e.g. expected deaths).
Only applicable when using the glm relative survival model with
Poisson regression)}

\item{types}{types of the columns that are used in the formula}

\item{family}{family type, Gaussian is used by default}

\item{tol:}{tolerance level}

\item{maxit:}{maximum number of iterations}
}
\value{
A GLM model in a dict format. To convert it to a GLM model which
 can be used by R, use the `vtg.glm::as.GLM(output)` to convert it.
}
\description{
