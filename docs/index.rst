IKNL algorithms for vantage6
============================
This documentation is generated from the repository `vantage6-algorithms
(github.com) <https://github.com/iknl/vantage6-algorithms>`_. This
documentation space is intended for the use of IKNL build algorithms that can
be executed in the `vantage6 (vantage6.ai) <https://vantage6.ai>`_
infrastructure.

The following topics will be discussed per algorithm:

1. Mathmatics

   * Central
   * Federated

2. Implementation

   * Parameters
   * Algorithm
   * Output

3. Risks
4. Validation
5. Usage examples

.. warning::

    You will not find here any technical documentation on the infrastructure.
    There is a seperate documentation `page (docs.vantage6.ai)
    <https://docs.vantage6.ai>`_ for this. There you can find documentation on
    how to use the infrastructure and how to build your own algorithms.
